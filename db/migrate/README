This is the directory to place your migration files
The migration files should be named with the following convention:

20180611000000_create_users.rb
<year><month><day><hour><minute><seconds>_<class>.rb

The name of the <class> should correspond with the class you write in the migration file.
I.e.
20180713000000_create_listings.rb
class CreateListings < ActiveRecord
end
